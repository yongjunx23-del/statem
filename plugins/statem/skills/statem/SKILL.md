# Statem

Use `statem` when the task is long-running, iterative, easy to lose track of, or benefits from explicit agent state. Prefer it as a runbook, not as a rigid harness.

## Workflow

1. Find or create a statem spec such as `statem.yaml`.
2. Validate it: `python3 -m statem validate statem.yaml --json`.
3. Start or resume a run: `python3 -m statem start statem.yaml --run-id <id> --json`.
4. Check state before acting: `python3 -m statem cur --run-id <id> --json`.
5. Move only through allowed edges: `python3 -m statem goto <node> --run-id <id> --json`.
6. Save progress before pausing: `python3 -m statem save --run-id <id> --json`.
7. For handoff context, read recent history: `python3 -m statem history --run-id <id> --tail 10 --json`.

Use `statem` instead of `python3 -m statem` if the CLI is installed on PATH.

For dynamic servers, company machines, or disposable git checkouts, prefer a
machine-local state directory. Set `STATEM_STATE_DIR` once, for example
`$HOME/.local/state/statem/<project>`, so runtime state survives checkout
replacement. After moving to a new checkout, run `statem start <spec> --run-id
<id>` once to rebind the run to the current spec path.

Commit YAML runbooks with the repo. Do not commit runtime state; treat `.statem/`
or `STATEM_STATE_DIR` as local, copy-on-use execution data.

## Context Clear

Avoid `/clear` in normal loops. It flushes the conversation, including any
instructions that were supposed to run after it, and can lose useful intent that
was not written to durable files. Prefer explicit transitions plus safe
compaction.

Before a hard clear, generate a durable resume prompt:

```bash
python3 -m statem prompt --run-id <id>
```

Paste the generated prompt immediately after `/clear`. The agent must recover
from `.statem` with `start`, `cur`, and `history`; it should not rely on any
pre-clear conversation.

## Loop Compaction

For cyclic runbooks, prefer an explicit session hygiene node after a full loop.
When continuing another cycle and context is noisy, generate a safe compaction
instruction:

```bash
python3 -m statem compact-prompt --run-id <id>
```

Run the generated `/compact` instruction through the host UI, then recover with
`statem cur` and `statem history --tail 10`. Do not use hidden self-messaging
to trigger compaction.

Agents may inspect the full graph with `statem state`; `cur`, `next`, and `goto`
are for disciplined execution and attention anchoring, not for hiding the
runbook.

## Auto Loop Hook

When this skill is installed through the bundled Codex plugin, the plugin also
registers `hooks/hooks.json`. Once the user reviews and trusts that plugin hook,
the Stop hook can keep an unfinished statem run moving after Codex would
otherwise hand control back to the user. The bundled hook resolves its script
from `$PLUGIN_ROOT`, so it does not depend on an absolute checkout path.

For non-plugin installs or other hosts with a compatible Stop hook, users may
opt into the same behavior with `integrations/hooks/statem_stop_hook.py`.
Registration examples live in:

- `examples/hooks/README.md`
- `examples/hooks/codex-stop-autoloop.hooks.json`
- `examples/hooks/claude-stop-autoloop.settings.json`

The hook runs when the agent is about to hand control back to the user. If a
statem run is active, the current node is not a terminal/handoff node, and there
are outgoing transitions, it returns a continuation prompt that tells the agent
to inspect `statem cur` and keep working from the current node.

Treat this as host-level glue. It must not advance state, run `/clear`, or hide
the graph. The agent should still transition only with `statem goto`.

## Authoring Specs

- Keep the static spec separate from `.statem/` runtime state.
- Use natural-language checks for low-friction runbooks.
- Use `in_hook` for setup after entering a node.
- Use `before_transfer` for redo/check loops while still in the current node.
  It is a spec field, not a CLI command; `statem goto` runs it automatically.
- Use `out_hook` to persist current-node progress before leaving.
- Use edge `hook` as prepare-transfer work after `out_hook` and before entering
  the target. If a blocking edge hook fails, the pointer stays at the source so
  the agent can retry.
- Use `type: command` for deterministic shell checks.
- Use `type: predicate` for file existence, non-empty files, text matches, and JSON-path checks.
- Use `type: llm_review` when another model, agent, or script should review before a transition.

Do not manually edit `.statem/runs/<run-id>/state.json` unless the user explicitly asks for runtime surgery.
